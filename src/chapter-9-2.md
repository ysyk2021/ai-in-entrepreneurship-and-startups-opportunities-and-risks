* **Transparency and explainability:** AI systems should be transparent, and their decision-making processes should be explainable to stakeholders.
* **Data quality and bias mitigation:** Startups must ensure that their data is of high quality and free from bias to prevent biased outcomes from AI systems.
* **Risk assessment and management:** Startups must assess and manage the risks associated with AI use, including legal and regulatory compliance, privacy concerns, and reputational risks.
* **Monitoring and evaluation:** Startups must continuously monitor and evaluate their AI systems to ensure they are operating ethically and effectively.
